GCfit is a Python package enabling the creation and extension of
distribution-function based lowered isothermal
(`LIMEPY <https://github.com/mgieles/limepy>`_) models,
representing globular cluster (GC) systems, as well as the generalized
fitting of these models to various observational GC data products, via a
parallelized bayesian sampling suite.
