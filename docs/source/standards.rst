=============================================
Observational Data Standards and Requirements
=============================================

For advanced users only:

All observational data files must follow a strict standard, and be kept
in exactly the right locations, following the right requirements. Most Milky
Way globular clusters already exist within ``GCfit`` with a large number of
observables, however users might wish to add or modify certain datasets, or
work with non-MW cluster analogues. To do so will require creating their own
observations files.

Most users should not attempt (**at this time**) to construct their own data
files. If you do want to do this, using the relevant ``util.data`` functions
will handle all formatting, and check that all standards are met. See those
functions for more details.

The ``GCfit`` data product catalogue exists as a static document describing all
currently supported datasets, and their requirements, for your interest. It can
be downloaded `here <_static/DPC.pdf>`_.
