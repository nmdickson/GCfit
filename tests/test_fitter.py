# -- TEST.hdf has a mix of M62 nd 47Tuc data, especially in PM, be careful --

# test all likelihood functions

# test determine components

# test convertors

# test model creation, somehow

# test priors by calling posterior with outside bounds data

# test posterior


# not sure how to test main?
#   maybe run full mcmc for a very very small sample
#   maybe try to test individual parts of main?
#   maybe try testing similar setup of mcmc but sepearate from main?
#   all these kinda suck
